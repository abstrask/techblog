## Resum√©

As a seasoned Senior Cloud Engineer, I architect and deploy robust, scalable cloud-native solutions using AWS, Kubernetes, and Terraform.

My goal is to lower the barrier for teams to leverage cloud and container technologies, helping bring their ideas to life.

I achieve this through an AWS "account factory" with preconfigured DNS domain delegation, OIDC providers, IAM etc. Or our Kubernetes platform template, equipped with features such as support for AI/GPU workloads, auto-scaling (including to/from zero), long-running batch jobs, declarative blue/green node groups, spot instances, and more.

As a DevOps advocate, I offer internal consultancy on AWS cloud best practices, guiding teams to architect secure, scalable, and cost-effective solutions.

I consider myself an expert in Terraform, rigorously defining infrastructure-as-code, and automating processes using tools like GitHub Actions, Python, and FaaS.

TL;DR: I have been living and breathing AWS, Kubernetes ([since 1.9](https://kubernetes.io/blog/2017/12/kubernetes-19-workloads-expanded-ecosystem/), AWS EKS [since launch day](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/amazon-eks-now-generally-available/)), Terraform ([since 0.11](https://www.hashicorp.com/en/blog/hashicorp-terraform-0-11)) and automation since 2018, on top of 18 years as a SysAdmin.

## Main skills

- Kubernetes and Amazon EKS
- Amazon Web Services
- Terraform
- Platform Engineering

## Other achievements

- Created [**Flux Helm Diff**](../posts/flux-helm-diff). A GitHub Action that renders [Flux CD](https://fluxcd.io/) Helm manifests on pull requests, 100% client-side, and posts the diff as a [comment on the PR](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/flux-helm-diff#example-outputpr-comment)
- Identified and documented a [bug in **Kubernetes Cluster Autoscaler**](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/issues/6481), together with my colleague, {{< person url="https://wcarlsen.github.io/" name="Willi Carlsen" picture="https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/17003032" >}}. Then worked with him to [develop af fix](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/pull/6482), which was included in release [1.31.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/autoscaler/releases/tag/cluster-autoscaler-1.31.0).
- Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) in 2020

## Recent Experience

### Veo Technologies ApS

**Senior Cloud Engineer** (May 2022 - Present)

Each week, we process and analyse upwards of 50,000 videos at Veo, with massive fluctuation throughout the days and hours, going back and forth between near-0 and full speed.

Me and my team design, build and operate the platform that ensures our customers get their videos and analytics swiftly.

As we grow, we meet and overcome new limitations all the time, while continuing to improve efficiency and lower the error rate.
